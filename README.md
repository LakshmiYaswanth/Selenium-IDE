# what is selenium?
Selenium is one of the most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite.
Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms and programming languages.
Selenium can be easily deployed on platforms such as Windows, Linux, Solaris and Macintosh.
It supports OS (Operating System) for mobile applications like iOS, windows mobile and android.
# what is Automation Testing?
Automation testing uses the specialized automation tools to run the test cases that was manually  
written by the tester with out any human intervention.Automation testing tools can access the test data,
controls the execution of tests and compares the actual result against the expected result.
# Types of Automation tools for function testing.
1.Quick test professional.
2.selenium tools.
3.coded Ui.
4.Rational robot.
# Types of automation tools for non functional testing.
1.Jmeter.
2.load runner.

# why Automation testing?
1. Automated testing has been considered beneficial for big software organizations.
2. It is too expensive or difficult for smaller companies to implement.
3. Automated testing tools can be programmed to build and execute test scripts at a specific time without involving any human intervention.
4. For instance,automated test can be automatically kicked off overnight, and the testers can analyse the results of the automated the next morning.
5. Automated testing tools are able to playback pre-recorded and pre-defined actions.
6. Automation testing supports frequent regression testing.
7. It provides rapid feedback to developers.
8. It provides documentation of test cases.
9. Automated test generates defect reports.
10. Less error occured as compared to manual testing
# Test Automation for web application.
 . Now a day all the application are web based application 
 . most of the web application most of the software applications are written as web-based applications to be run in an internet browser.
 . The testing strategy for web-based applications varies widely among companies and organizations.
 . The most effective manner to carry out test automation for web application is to adopt a pyramid testing strategy.

# Selenium Features
   . Selenium is an open source and portable Web testing Framework.
   . Selenium supports various operating systems, browsers and programming languages. Following is the list:
          1.Programming Languages: C#, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, and JavaScript
          2.Operating Systems: Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris.
          3.Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Opera, Safari, etc.
# selenium limitation
  . Selenium does not support automation testing for desktop applications.
  . Selenium requires high skill sets in order to automate tests more effectively.
  . Since Selenium is open source software, you have to rely on community forums to get your technical issues resolved.
  . We cant perform automation tests on web services like SOAP or REST using Selenium.
  . We should know at least one of the supported programming languages to create tests scripts in Selenium WebDriver.  
# selenium Tool suit
Selenium is not just a single tool but a suite of softwares, each with a different approach to support automation testing. It comprises of four major components which include:
1. Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
2. Selenium Remote Control (Now Deprecated)
3. WebDriver
4. Selenium Grid
