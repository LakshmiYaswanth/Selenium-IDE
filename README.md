5. Automated testing tools are able to playback pre-recorded and pre-defined actions.
6. Automation testing supports frequent regression testing.
7. It provides rapid feedback to developers.
8. It provides documentation of test cases.
9. Automated test generates defect reports.
10. Less error occured as compared to manual testing
